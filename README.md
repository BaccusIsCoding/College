# College

Hello! This is my college repository. As stated in my profile, I'm an Electrical Engineering student, currently learning C and Python.
I've created this folder so I can store my codes and any useful things I learn along the way.
At the time I'm writing this, this folder is still private, but it may change in the future, as I intend on sharing my learning progress.

That's it, let's code!!
